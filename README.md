# Halloween Projects

Click to green button on top right that say "Use this template", and then name your project.

Later, on if you want to organize your code, you can create a project from "Projects" tab, and to-do lists, and such.

You can choose whether you want to make your code public or private. 

If you haven't joined a team, you can contact me from Slacker.
